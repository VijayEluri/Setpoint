<h1>Setpoint</h1>
<p>
  The Setpoint Add-On is intended to demonstrate reading / writing of setpoints and determining schedule group membership.
  It allows a user to specify setpoint values that will be applied to all the members of a schedule group.  It is
  using schedule groups in an unconventional way to group equipment for a purpose other than scheduling.
</p>
<p>
   This Add-On is implemented using a popular web application framework, <a target="_blank" href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>.
</p>
<h2>Try it out</h2>
<p>
   Deploy the Setpoint sample add-on by executing the 'deploy' task and starting (if necessary) the server.
</p>
<p>
   Browse to <span class="examp">http://yourserver/setpoint</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/setpoint">open on localhost</a>).
   This should present a login page.  Log in with any valid operator and password.
   The left hand side should list the available schedule groups.  Click on a group, then you can specify occupied and unoccupied
   setpoints on the right hand side.  When you click apply, these setpoints will be applied to all equipment in the
   setpoint group.
</p>
<h2>Important Lessons</h2>
<p>
   <span class="examp">GroupSetpoint.writeToComponents</span> is the method that actually writes to all of the
   <a target="_blank" href="../../docs/javadoc/index.html?com/controlj/green/addonsupport/access/aspect/SetPoint.html">SetPoint</a>
   objects.  Note that this method is called from <span class="examp">GroupSetpoint.save</span> (from inside of a
   <span class="examp">SystemConnection.runWriteAction</span>).  This save method also gets a <span class="examp">DataStore</span>
   and saves the setpoints so they can be recalled for this group later.
